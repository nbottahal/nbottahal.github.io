<h2>About me</h2>
Hello, I'm Nicholas Ottahal, also simply known as Nick! I'm a university student who is currently trying creative writing out. Within my works, you'll be able to read more about my queerness, as well as some scenes in my (unfortunately continuing) struggles with my mental health, such as rumination (as indicated in this page's tagline). Constructive feedback is always welcomed and can be delivered through contacting me with the information below, and I hope you enjoy my work!<br><br>

P.S. I pronounce my surname as /ˈɔtʌhəʊl/ in IPA, or something like <em>Otta-hole</em> in terms of respelling.

<h2>My works</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="assets/the_university_crush.pdf">The University Crush</a></strong>
<p style="text-indent: 15px;">A fictional sonnet about my first crush at university.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 15px;"><em>No content warnings</em></p>
</ul>
